I was present in class today. We discussed the pre class readings, did some work analyzing a series of 4 graphs and using the information from the reading to evaluate/improve the graphs. We then turned our attention to starting to discuss questions that could be used in the interviews for Homework #1. I am making this text document as record of my attendance and participation. --NH
